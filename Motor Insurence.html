   <h1>Motor insurance </h1> </div>
    <div>
    </div>(also known as auto insurance, car insurance, or motor insurance) is insurance purchased for cars, trucks, and other vehicles. Its primary use is to provide protection against losses incurred as a result of traffic accidents and against liability that could be incurred in an accident.
</div>
Under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, all vehicles that ply in public places must have an insurance policy that at least covers “Third Party Liability” as specified under the Act. A Comprehensive Motor Insurance Cover in addition to the mandatory third-party cover also protects the car owner from financial losses, caused by loss or damage or theft of the vehicle.
